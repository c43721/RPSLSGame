###Some notes on this project: 
This was the first ever time I've worked with Classes and objects in any language. I was taught Java using the main method and nothing more, and javascript is functions galore. I had a very high expectation of myself, and fell short of that while working on this. Ideally, I wanted to be able to use the emojies on the page to control your action, but that was scrapped as it proved to be difficult for me to achieve time-wise without looking for hours for an answer. A simpler approach was made, and a button was created to control the flow of the game. I'd also like to come back to this maybe one day to remind myself of better approaches to control "game-state".
